Bruno is a Professor of Computer Science and English Language and Literature from Croatia's northernmost town. A cryptoenthusiast from the early days of Ethereum, Bruno opened Bitfalls as a company in 2017 with the express purpose of helping blockchain technology become more mainstream, and to help the uninitiated avoid scams and pyramid schemes in both investment opportunities and technological upgrades.

When he's not walking his beagle or playing board games, you'll find him complaining about JavaScript [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitfalls), writing about PHP for [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/bskvorc), or working as a developer advocate for [Diffbot](https://diffbot.com). You can also find him in virtual reality from time to time - TheSwader on Oculus.
